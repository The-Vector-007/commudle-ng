# Contributing to Commudle

We're building the world's largest platform for Tech Communities and every contribution matters.

This is the front end of the platform and is based on Angular 2+ (we keep updating to the latest version fast)

Though we'd like to keep it informal, but here's some guidelines to keep in mind while contributing

### Creating an Issue

An issue can be created for the following

- Reporting a bug
- Proposing a new feature or a fix
- Proposing a better coding strategy

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Submitting a Pull Request

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use Github Flow). We actively welcome your pull
requests.

### The instructions to setup the repository in a local environment are mentioned in the [ReadMe](README.md)

#### Branch Names

Your branches should be named with a prefix for their purpose, viz.

- New Feature: `feature-branchname`
- Urgent Fix: `hotfix-branchname`
- Bug Fix: `fix-branchname`
  In the above examples, replace `branchname` with the name of your branch.

#### Extra Guidelines

- Comment on the issue by introducing yourself and asking to solve it
- For complicated issues, brainstorming with some screenshots will be needed from both sides so that the maintainers and
  you, both are on the same line of thought
- Keep a consistent coding style
- Ensure your PR mentions which issue it is closing
- Always feel free to reach out for help in comments
